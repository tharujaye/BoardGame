The purpose of this assignment is to create and put into action a
straightforward board game ("20 x 2") that can be played by a human
player and a computer. A 20-block board is used in the game, and
players roll dice to move their pawns. In order to win, a player must
be the first to the 20th block or pass it. The player's piece can only
enter the board after rolling a six on the dice, and the game features
two black holes that penalize the player if they are landed upon.
